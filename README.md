In honor of A.B. Kahn the inventor of [Kahn's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn.27s_algorithm).

This little library manages state in an opinionated way, by storing all of it as a map in a clojure atom.
That's right, we put all the mutable state in one globally accessible atom. It's great.
